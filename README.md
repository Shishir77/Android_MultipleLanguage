# Android_MultipleLanguage
The following application demonstrates the use of a ListView to display items in rows. An action can be triggered by the selection (click) of an item; in this application the action is to display a different pop-up message ("toast") for each item. If the language setting of the phone is set to "French", the mechanics of the application stays the same (a pop-up is displayed when an item is clicked) but it is the French translations of each character strings (items, as well as pop-up messages) that are displayed.
